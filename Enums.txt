Enums:
An enum is a special type in Java used to define a set of constant values (fixed values that do not change). It helps make the code more readable and type-safe.
⦁	Declared using the keyword enum.
⦁	Enum constants are public, static, and final by default.
⦁	Used when you have a fixed set of related constants — like days, directions, colors, etc.
⦁	You can also add methods and variables inside an enum.
Example:
enum Day {
    SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY;
}
class TestEnum {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Day d = Day.MONDAY;
        System.out.println(d); 
    }
}
